          In April 2017, I met Elissa, a student living with Dystonia, a neurological movement disorder. She experiences
          limited hand mobility, arm and muscle weakness and the inability to hold and control a writing utensil. Before
          her condition worsened, she was a talented painter but now, she cannot hold onto a paintbrush. Her condition
          affects her mobility in daily activities and leads to emotional consequences such as a loss of independence
          and educational difficulties. Elissa inspired me to invent the first prototype of Guided Hands&trade; as my
          final school project at McMaster University. <br />

        <br /> By May 2019, I redesigned, manufactured and introduced Guided Hands&trade; to patients and medical
        professionals in hospital clinics, rehabilitation centres, nursing homes and retirement homes. Guided
        Hands&trade; had given the patients hope and happiness as they painted, wrote, coloured or played games on an
        iPad. The device is capable of reigniting one’s passion or simply giving them the ability to express themselves
        in their own creative and independent way! The positive feedback received from Guided Hands&trade; encouraged me
        to continue developing my project. <br />

        In August 2019, armed with paint supplies and Guided Hands&trade;, I joined a 12-year-old little girl living
        with Dystonia and her family at their doctor’s appointment. As soon as she began painting, the widest smile
        spread across her face. She turned to her mom and said, “Mom I want one” and her mom turned to me and asked,
        “How much is it?”. At that point, the thought of selling the device had never even crossed my mind. However,
        with the passion and drive to help more children and adults like her, I created ImaginAble Solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <br /> Today, my team and I are encouraged to grow our company to provide Guided Hands&trade; to those that
        imagine a life of independence and opportunity.
